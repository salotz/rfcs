* 016: Nearly Trivial Plaintext Formats

This spec is more about being able to easily recognize when a file is
truly simple and not actually more complex.


** A "list" file

A file where each line will be parsed as a separate
string. Essentially a newline separated ("\n") list of tokens.

Supports '#' comments.

Has a ~.list~ extension.

** A "string" file

Sometimes you want a file that has a single string in it that should
just be read directly and not parsed.

Has a ~.str~ extension.

This is distinct from a ~.txt~ file in that the TXT file is freeform
and no parsing is intended. The file is intended to be read by a user
as-is.

Furthermore, a TXT file shouldn't contain "data" like an 'str' file
would in the sense of a programming language might.
