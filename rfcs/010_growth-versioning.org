* 010: Growth Mindset Versioning

Before what you would call the "1.0" release in semantic versioning
you have versions that are just version "0" and the datetime they are
released.

This is because before 1.0 you should be moving fast and breaking
things, and people shouldn't be hooking into your APIs anyways yet.

After you hit 1.0 we follow the format 'g-b-r' where 'g' stands for
growth versions, 'b' stands for breakage releases, and 'r' stands for
regression releases.

Projects should aim to always keep a 0 b and r.
