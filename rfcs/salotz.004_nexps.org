* 004: Name Expressions (nexps)

Example:

~format:namespace.field-1_field-2~

The '.' is used as a namespace separator. Items to the right of it are
said to be "refinements" of the name to the left.  Underscores '_'
separate different "fields" in a refinement. Fields have equal
priority in describing the refinement. Hyphens are used as whitespace
or other symbolic separator within a field name.

This approach was chosen for compatibility with POSIX filenames and
was inspired in part by the Rebol programming language (which
unfortunately cannot be expressed in filenames).

A field that starts with a '#' will be considered a tag.
